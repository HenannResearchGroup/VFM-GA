# VFM-GA
A calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models, synergizing the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method.

A Matlab-Fortran interface and the Fortran code package for the first and second functionalities of the VFM-GA framework are provided. To use with the Matlab-Fortran interface, first go to the subdirectory for the 1stfunc or 2ndfunc, and then run the Matlab codes S1_, S2_, and S3_ and follow the instructions step by step. To use Fortran code package directly, go to the GA_fort folder directly in the respective subdirectory.
